 In this simple project, I will try to find out young talents who are similar to **Lionel Messi** in specific domain of the sport like **passing**, **chances creating ability** etc.
 For this I will be using **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to group players together and will present my results in Tableau, later I will write my analysis in a medium blog.
 Here is the link to the Tableau Dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/harsh.kondkar/viz/MessisSuccessors/MessisPotentialSuccessors
