 In this simple project, I will try to find out young talents(strikers in particular) who are similar to a given well known striker based on certain relavant attributes like `Goals`, `expected goals`, `Shots on target` etc.
 For this I will be using **K-Means Clustering** algorithm to group players together.

 The second part of this project is to find players similar to **Lionel Messi** based on the attributes relavant to a playmaker.
 Here too, I have grouped players together using K-Means Clustering Algorithm and presented it in Tableau.
